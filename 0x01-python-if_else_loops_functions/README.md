# 0x01-Python - if/else, loops, functions

This repository contains Python solutions for various tasks related to if/else statements, loops, and functions. Each task is described below.

## Tasks

1. **Task 0: Positive anything is better than negative nothing**

   This program assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. It then uses an if/else statement to determine whether the number is positive or negative and prints the result. It's a simple introduction to using conditional statements in Python.

2. **Task 1: The last digit**

   This program assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. It extracts and prints the last digit of the number, demonstrating how to work with mathematical operations and variables in Python.

3. **Task 2: I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**

   This program prints the entire ASCII alphabet in lowercase, all on the same line without new lines in between. It showcases the use of loops to iterate through characters and the `chr()` function to convert ASCII values to characters.

4. **Task 3: When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**

   This program is similar to Task 2 but with a twist. It prints the lowercase ASCII alphabet, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'. It demonstrates how to use loops and conditional statements to selectively print characters.

5. **Task 4: Hexadecimal printing**

   This program prints numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal format. It highlights how to work with number formatting and showcases the use of loops for iteration.

6. **Task 5: 00...99**

   This program simply prints numbers from 0 to 99. It's a straightforward example of using loops for counting and printing.

Feel free to explore each task's Python code to see how these concepts are implemented.

## How to Run

To run each task, execute the corresponding Python script. For example, to run Task 0, use the following command:

```bash
./python_script.py
```
